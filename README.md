## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Challenge 3 (Game Cards): Ensuring proper DOM manipulation with template literals to display game details dynamically required careful handling of HTML structure and CSS styling.

Challenge 5 (Filtering): Implementing deleteChildElements correctly in filter functions was critical to prevent duplicate game cards from accumulating.

Challenge 6 (Company Description): Using the ternary operator for grammatical correctness (e.g., “1 game remains” vs. “7 games remain”) needed precise logic to handle edge cases.

Challenge 7 (Top Games): Sorting and destructuring the games array to display the top two funded games required verifying the sort order and handling game names accurately.

Bonus Feature (Search Bar): Integrating a search function involved adding new HTML elements, styling them consistently with the existing design, and ensuring case-insensitive filtering worked robustly.

General: Debugging CSS flexbox layouts and hover effects to achieve a responsive and visually appealing design was iterative, especially for the game card grid.
